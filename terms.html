Always consult qualified healthcare or fitness professionals before starting any exercise program.</p>

    <p><strong>Exercise Database Limitations:</strong><br>

    <p><strong>Educational and Motivational Purposes:</strong><br>
    All workout routines, exercise instructions, and fitness content are designed to support your fitness journey. They are not guarantees of specific results or protection from injury.</p>

Lifted disclaims all liability for injuries or damages resulting from your use of the app or participation in fitness activities.</p>

    <p><strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong><br>
    While Lifted strives to provide accurate exercise information and instructions, we cannot guarantee that all content is free from errors or omissions. You are solely responsible for using proper form, appropriate weights, and safe exercise practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Health and Safety:</strong><br>
    You are responsible for ensuring you are physically capable of performing exercises. Stop exercising immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort, and consult a healthcare professional.</p>
