    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Lifted, an app designed to help users achieve their fitness goals through group accountability, workout tracking, and social fitness challenges. By accessing or using Lifted, you agree to the following Terms of Service (the "Terms"). These Terms explain your rights, responsibilities, and our limitations of liability. Please read them carefully before using the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

    <p>You must be at least 13 years old or the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction to use Lifted. Users under 18 should use the app with parental guidance and consent.</p>

    <h2>2. General Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>No Medical or Professional Advice:</strong><br>
    Lifted is a fitness tracking and accountability tool. The app's features—including workout routines, exercise suggestions, supplement tracking, and fitness tracking—are not substitutes for professional medical, fitness, nutritional, or health advice. Always consult qualified healthcare or fitness professionals before starting any exercise program or making changes to your diet or supplement regimen.</p>

    <p><strong>Exercise Database Limitations:</strong><br>
    Lifted's exercise database provides general information and instructions. However, results may not always be accurate, complete, or suitable for your individual needs. You agree that you use these tools at your own discretion and risk.</p>

    <p><strong>Educational and Motivational Purposes:</strong><br>
    All workout routines, exercise instructions, supplement tracking features, and fitness content are designed to support your fitness journey. They are not guarantees of specific results or protection from injury.</p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities and Risks</h2>
    <p><strong>Use at Your Own Risk:</strong><br>
    You understand and accept that using Lifted involves certain risks, including but not limited to physical injury, incorrect exercise form, or reliance on user-generated workout content. Lifted disclaims all liability for injuries or damages resulting from your use of the app or participation in fitness activities.</p>

    <p><strong>Accuracy of Information:</strong><br>
    While Lifted strives to provide accurate exercise information and instructions, we cannot guarantee that all content is free from errors or omissions. You are solely responsible for using proper form, appropriate weights, safe exercise practices, and making informed decisions about your fitness and supplement regimen.</p>

    <p><strong>Health and Safety:</strong><br>
    You are responsible for ensuring you are physically capable of performing exercises. Stop exercising immediately if you experience pain, dizziness, or discomfort, and consult a healthcare professional.</p>

    <p><strong>Community Conduct:</strong><br>
    Users are expected to engage respectfully within Lifted's group features, social feed, and comment sections. Harassment, inappropriate content, hate speech, explicit imagery, spam, or misuse of check-in features is strictly prohibited and may result in account suspension or permanent removal. See our Community Guidelines for full details.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Lifted and its developers, employees, affiliates, and partners disclaim all liability for any damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Direct or Indirect Damages:</strong> Including physical injury, health complications, or personal harm resulting from exercise activities or following fitness/nutrition information from the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Incidental or Consequential Damages:</strong> Including data loss, device malfunction, account suspension, or loss of subscription benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Information Accuracy:</strong> The app's exercise database and instructions are provided "as-is" and without guarantees of accuracy or suitability for your individual needs.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We are not responsible for content posted by other users, including check-in photos, workout posts, or comments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In no event shall Lifted's total liability exceed the amount paid by you for using the app in the past 12 months, or $10, whichever is greater.</p>

    <h2>5. Privacy and Data Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Collection and Use:</strong><br>
    Lifted collects and stores user data to enable app features such as workout tracking, group accountability, check-in photos, comments, and social interactions. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for complete details.</p>

    <p><strong>No Unauthorized Sharing:</strong><br>
    Lifted will not sell or share user data with third parties for marketing purposes without explicit consent, except as required by law or as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>Group Visibility:</strong><br>
    Check-in photos, workout logs, comments, reactions, and activity shared within groups are visible to all group members. By joining a group, you consent to this visibility and understand that other members can see your content.</p>

    <h2>6. User-Generated Content and Interactions</h2>
    <p><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong><br>
    You may not share or upload harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content. This includes but is not limited to: harassment, bullying, hate speech, explicit imagery, nudity, violence, spam, promotional content, or content that violates others' rights. Violation of these rules will result in content removal and may result in account termination.</p>

    <p><strong>Check-In Photos:</strong><br>
    Check-in photos must follow daily prompts and be appropriate for a fitness context. Misuse of the check-in feature (fake photos, inappropriate content, photos unrelated to fitness) may result in content removal, warnings, or account suspension.</p>

    <p><strong>Comments and Social Features:</strong><br>
    Comments must be respectful and fitness-related. Do not post spam, harassment, or off-topic content. Users can report inappropriate comments, and repeated violations will result in account suspension.</p>

    <p><strong>License to User Content:</strong><br>
    By posting or submitting content (e.g., check-in photos, workout logs, comments, reactions), you grant Lifted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, reproduce, and distribute that content as necessary to operate the app and its social features.</p>

    <p><strong>Content Moderation:</strong><br>
    We reserve the right to review, moderate, and remove any user-generated content that violates these Terms or our Community Guidelines. Reported content will be reviewed within 24 hours. Users who repeatedly violate our policies will be permanently banned.</p>
